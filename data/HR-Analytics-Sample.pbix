DAX MASTERY QUEST - SAMPLE DATA INSTRUCTIONS

To follow along with the DAX challenges, you'll need sample data in Power BI.

OPTION 1: Create Your Own Sample Data
1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Go to Home → Enter Data
3. Create a table called "Sales" with these columns:
   - Sales Amount (numbers like 1000, 1500, 2000)
   - Quantity (numbers like 5, 10, 15)
   - Unit Price (numbers like 200, 150, 133)
   - Product (text like "Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard")
   - Date (dates from 2022-01-01 to 2023-12-31)
   - Customer ID (numbers like 1001, 1002, 1003)
   - Profit (numbers like 200, 300, 400)

4. Create a table called "Products" with:
   - Product (same as Sales table)
   - Category (Electronics, Office, Accessories)

5. Create a table called "Customers" with:
   - Customer ID (same as Sales table)
   - Customer Name (John Doe, Jane Smith, etc.)
   - Region (North, South, East, West)

6. Create relationships between tables:
   - Sales[Product] → Products[Product]
   - Sales[Customer ID] → Customers[Customer ID]

OPTION 2: Use Sample Data from Power BI
1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Click "Try a sample dataset"
3. Choose "Financial Sample" or similar
4. Use this data to practice DAX formulas
